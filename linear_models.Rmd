# use this formula 
```{r linear}

#As we’ll see shortly, interactions between variables can be specified using *. You can also specify an intercept-only model (outcome ~ 1), a model with no intercept (outcome ~ 0 + ...), and a model using all available predictors (outcome ~ .).

#for categotical variable,  the factor level is treated as the reference. As with ggplot, being careful with factors is therefore critical!

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(
    borough = fct_infreq(borough),
    room_type = fct_infreq(room_type))

fit = lm(price ~ stars + borough, data = nyc_airbnb)
#It’s important to note that changing reference categories won’t change “fit” or statistical sigificance, but can affect ease of interpretation.
